# DataScienceSalaryDashboard

In the course of Presentation and Visualization of Information, we were tasked with addressing a problem related to the analysis and visualization of information in information systems context. This work was divided into three fundamental parts, each playing a crucial role in understanding and solving the problem.

The topic chosen was "Data Science Job Salaries."

To develop the solution, and before proceeding to its conception, we thought about the structure of our solution and decided that it would consist of four dashboards. A general dashboard will provide an overview of salary trends, which can be useful to the 3 personas detailed in this project:

 - For recent graduates or entry-level workers, we consider it pertinent to cross-reference the data with cost-of-living factors. This is because at an initial stage, the recent graduate seeks financial stability and a balance between the offered salary and the costs associated with daily life. Cost of living becomes crucial to ensure that the offered salary not only covers basic expenses but also allows for a satisfactory quality of life.

 - For experienced professionals, we will present data cross-referenced with quality of life metrics. At a more advanced stage of experience, experienced professionals seek to make choices more aligned with their personal and professional goals, ensuring a rewarding and balanced career trajectory. They often value the balance between professional and personal life and recognize the importance of emotional and mental well-being.

 - Regarding the recruiter/human resources professional persona, we will cross-reference the main information with data related to the factors most valued by professionals regarding working conditions, company, and position they hold. This approach allows for a more effective strategy in talent attraction and retention, enabling the development of personalized strategies to attract qualified candidates and retain talent within the company.
